Some of the features to be upgradeed.
== Support for OSX. ==
Needs testing. But one of the first errors comes with "mktemp".

== Create XLSX file  ==
Options:
https://github.com/pyexcel/pyexcel-cli
https://gitlab.com/DerLinkshaender/csv2xlsx

== Create separate internal report ==
This report is intended for our use, basic statistics on
most common variants found. % of strains etc.

== Add context alignments to report ==
I find useful to have context alignments in the form:
ATTC-----
A-TC-----
in the spreadsheet.

== Map OMS names to Pangolin names==
Having a map table would help
